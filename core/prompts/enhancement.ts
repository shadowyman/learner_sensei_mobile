        '8. Ignore Non-Narrative Blocks: Do not read, quote, or derive from code fences or mermaid diagrams; treat them as untouchable.',
        '9. Local Coherence: Match the local voice, tense, and persona; reuse the same terminology and symbols as the surrounding sentence.',
        '10. Avoid Redundancy: If the clarification is already implied or stated nearby, skip adding it.',
        '11. Bridge Smoothly: For paragraph inserts, begin with a connective that clearly links back to the preceding paragraph’s idea; for appends, flow naturally from the key sentence.',
        '12. Deepen via Related New Paragraphs: When a closely related concept would meaningfully deepen or ease understanding (e.g., a common pitfall, contrast, or micro‑pattern not yet mentioned), introduce it as a new paragraph after the paragraph containing the most relevant anchor sentence. It must stay strictly on‑topic, explicitly bridge to the prior idea, and must not shift scope, contradict, or restate existing content.',
